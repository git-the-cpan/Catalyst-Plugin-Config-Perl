=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Plugin::Config::Perl - use Panda::Config::Perl with catalyst.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<Panda::Config::Perl> for synopsis of config files.

    use Catalyst 'Config::Perl';

    ...
    
    $cfg = $myapp->config;
    $cfg = $myapp->cfg; # the same but much faster
    if ($myapp->dev) { ... } # alias for $myapp->cfg->{dev}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin automatically processes configs via L<Panda::Config::Perl>'s C<process> passing C<local.conf> as starting config file if
it exists. If it doesn't, C<conf/[myapp].conf> is used.

If you want other file to be used, set C<file> option of this module's config before setup phase. For example:

    MyApp->config->{'Plugin::Config::Perl'}{file} = 'conf/myfile.conf'; # path is relative to the project's dir

This plugin passes C<MyApp->config> as an initial config for L<Panda::Config::Perl>'s C<process>.

This plugin is a new version of L<Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigLoader::MultiState>.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item dev

    Development server flag. $c->dev is true if current installation is development.
    Also available through $c->cfg->{dev}.

=item cfg

    Fast accessor for getting config hash.
    It is 30x faster than original ->config accessor.

=item setup

    Called by catalyst at setup phase. Initializes config.

=item finalize_config

This method is called after the config file has been processed. It can be used to implement tuning of config values that can only
be done at runtime.

=back

=head1 Startup perfomance

    It takes about 9ms to initialize config system with 30 files (225kb summary) on Core i7 3930K.
